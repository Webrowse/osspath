/**
 * INV-1 guard: the public render path must never import PostgreSQL or auth.
 *
 * The public website is fully static and must generate zero database queries
 * for visitors. PostgreSQL is reachable only from the Refresh pipeline and the
 * build-time export. This guard fails the build if any route under app/
 * (except app/admin/** and app/api/auth/**) imports @/lib/prisma, @/lib/auth,
 * or anything under @/lib/admin.
 *
 * INV-2 guard: the public render path must never load the full OSS corpus.
 *
 * content/oss.json is ~35MB with per-repo relationships/enrichment blobs that
 * only the single-repo detail page needs. Every other public route reads the
 * slim build-time projection (content/oss-list.json) via lib/oss-data.ts.
 * This guard fails the build if any file outside lib/oss-detail-data.ts and
 * app/oss/[owner]/[repo]/** imports @/lib/oss-detail-data or references
 * content/oss.json directly — so the production server can never end up
 * holding the full corpus in memory to serve a route that doesn't need it.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-public-purity.mjs
