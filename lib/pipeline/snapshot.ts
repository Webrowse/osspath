 * Deterministic snapshot of published content, materialised from PostgreSQL.

 * PostgreSQL is the source of truth; this module projects it into the exact
 * bytes that get committed to Git (one content/<type>.json per type). The
 * output must be byte-stable for identical DB state, or the publish step would
 * create spurious commits. Determinism comes from two things:
 *   1. A stable row order - readPublished() orders by (createdAt, id).
 *   2. Canonical serialisation - object keys sorted recursively, fixed
 *      indentation, trailing newline. jsonb does not preserve key order, so we
 *      normalise it here.
 *
 * This is the single export implementation. It is imported by the pipeline
 * (server action) and by scripts/export-snapshot.ts (CLI). It reads the DB
 * lazily via the shared Prisma client; importing it opens no connection.
